## Description

This project is a backend API for a social network application. It allows you to perform CRUD operations on User and Thought entities. Additionally, you can reply to a thought and establish connections between users by adding friends. With this API as a foundation, you have the opportunity to develop a polished UI/UX and create a full-stack website application.
